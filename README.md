🚮 Digital Dustbin using IoT
📌 Project Title
Design and Development of Automatic Sorting Dustbin for Railway Platforms
📅 Project Duration
August 2024 – Dec 2024
🏫 Institution
Shri Sant Gajanan Maharaj College of Engineering, Shegaon
📖 Project Overview
The Digital Dustbin using IoT is an automated waste segregation system designed to classify waste into metallic, wet, plastic, and dry categories. The system utilizes multiple sensors and a microcontroller to detect waste type and automatically direct it into the appropriate compartment.
This project aims to improve waste management efficiency, minimize manual intervention, and promote environmental sustainability, especially in high-traffic public areas such as railway platforms.
🎯 Objectives
- Automate the waste segregation process  
- Reduce manual handling of waste  
- Improve recycling efficiency  
- Promote cleanliness and environmental sustainability  
- Minimize health hazards caused by mixed waste
